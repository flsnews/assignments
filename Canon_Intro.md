####ABSTRACT

*Public health is a matter of great concern for politicians and legislators around the world: not only does it take up a relevant slice of a nation’s public budget, but it also deeply affects citizens’ quality of life. The behavioural economics approach of libertarian paternalism largely contributes to the already substantial literature on this matter. In the following canon, we give an overview of the aforementioned contributions by presenting the most important examples of practical applications. These include experiments on nudging people towards healthier lifestyles as well as articles on better schemes for organ donation and topics as the improvement of hygiene in hospitals.* 

####INTRODUCTION

How can we make people quit smoking? Which way is the best to increase the number of organ donators? Why are so many people unable to cope with choices concerning their health – and is it possible to improve their decisions? These questions are just a few out of many politicians and health managers permanently face when considering new regulations and policies regarding the system of public health. Doubtlessly, there are plenty of ways to answer them. The paper at hand tries to give an insight how the approach of Behavioural Economics and Libertarian Paternalism can help to deal with these issues.

Libertarian Paternalism is a term introduced by US economists Richard Thaler and law professor Cass Sunstein in their well-known bestseller “Nudge – Improving decisions about health, wealth and happiness” (2008). This book is one of the most influential works regarding Behavioural Economics, a new stream of economic theory taking into account that most people do not behave totally rational but also emotional and sometimes irrational. The general idea of Libertarian Paternalism is, that it is possible to improve people’s (sometimes poor) choices by nudging (i.e. softly push) them towards a (socially) desirable behaviour whilst still letting them the freedom to decide differently if they want so.

On the following pages we want to give an overview of how this approach can be applied to take care of public health. Summarising studies and papers of four applications, we show that there are many ways to improve public health by the insights of Behavioural Economics and that most of them are way easier to impose and cost-saving than many people expect.

This canon is divided into four chapters. It commences with a brief overview of the influence of manipulative advertisement and how the state can nudge people towards a healthier lifestyle. In the second chapter we discuss one of the most classic examples of Behavioural Economics and public health – the possibility to increase organ donations by imposing a default option so that every citizen is automatically an organ donator. Following to that we show what impact monitoring of hospital employees on hygiene can have and how patient’s choices at the doctors can be improved. Eventually we emphasise on the positive nudging effect smartphone apps and other devices can have to promote healthier lifestyles and choices.
